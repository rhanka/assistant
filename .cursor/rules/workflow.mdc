# WORKFLOW

## Principles
- Always read `README.md`, `RELEASE.md` (target version) and `TODO.md` (priorities).
- Propose a short action plan before coding. Request human approval when "⚠ approval".
- One PR per objective. Use Conventional Commits (feat:, fix:, chore:, refactor:, docs:, test:).

## BOOT (first run)
1. Open `TODO.md` and focus on **Now** items.
2. For each **Now** item, create a branch `boot/<slug>`.
3. Generate missing skeleton files or services.
4. Open a PR with a checklist. Wait for approval.

## FEATURE
1. Read the target `TODO.md` item (**Next** or **Now**).
2. Post a 3–6 step plan as the first PR comment.
3. Implement with guardrails (preview, dry-run, logs).
4. Update `TODO.md` (check item, reference PR) and `RELEASE.md` (scope).

## MAINTENANCE
- Small chores/refactors/docs. Same flow as FEATURE.

## RELEASE
1. Collect merged PRs since last tag (Conventional Commits).
2. Update `RELEASE.md` (notes, risks, rollback).
3. Open `release/x.y.z` PR with release checklist.
4. Tag + publish after human approval.

## Guardrails
- Never perform destructive DB/system actions without "⚠ approval".
- For Playwright/Cursor, always **simulate** before executing a critical action.
