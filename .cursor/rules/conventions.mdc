# CONVENTIONS
- Commits: Conventional Commits (feat:, fix:, chore:, refactor:, docs:, test:).
- Branches: `feat/<slug>`, `fix/<slug>`, `boot/<slug>`, `release/x.y.z`. Open only one at once
- PR: one capability per PR; checklist; clear description (objective + short plan).
- Never proceed more than one item of `TODO.md`
- Be minimalist in changes (don't refacto the whole to avoid regressions)
- Test before commit
- Commit messages and PR descriptions MUST be in English.
