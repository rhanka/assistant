# LANGUAGE POLICY
- All code, comments, commit messages, PR titles/descriptions, API schemas and server errors MUST be in **English**.
- All Markdown and MDC files MUST be in **English**.
- The UI MUST support **English and French** locales (`/en`, `/fr`) with `en` as fallback.
- Any UI copy change MUST update both `en/*.json` and `fr/*.json` and keep keys stable.
