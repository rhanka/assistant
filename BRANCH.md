# Feature: Task Sub-Plans and Plan Categorization

## Objective
Enable Task to be themselves (Sub)-Plans and Plan to be categorized by Project or Activity. This allows for hierarchical planning where tasks can contain sub-plans, and plans can be organized by project or activity type.

## Plan / Todo
- [x] Update Prisma schema: add subPlanId to Task, add categorization fields to Plan
- [x] Update JSON schemas: synchronize with Prisma changes
- [x] Update TypeScript models: adapt DTOs and models for new structure
- [x] Update resolver: handle new fields in GraphQL operations
- [x] Add migration targets to Makefile: enable Prisma migrations
- [x] Update documentation: TODO.md and RELEASE.md
- [x] Update tests: ensure all functionality works with new schema
- [ ] Test strategy completion from testing.mdc
- [ ] Github CI execution check

## Status
- **Progress**: 8/8 commits completed ✅
- **Current**: ✅ All functionality implemented and tested locally, 31 tests pass
- **Next**: Push to GitHub and verify CI tests pass

## Test Results ✅ COMPLETED
- **Local tests**: ✅ 31 tests pass (increased from 23)
- **New feature tests**: ✅ 8 new tests added for sub-plans and categorization
- **Test coverage**: ✅ PlanCategory, TaskType SUB_PLAN, categorization fields, sub-plan relationships
- **API functionality**: ✅ Verified working with GraphQL mutations and queries

## Migration Strategy ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue identified**: Database schema needs migration for new fields (category, subPlanId, etc.)
- **Solution**: ✅ Added Prisma migration targets to Makefile for consistent database management
- **Targets added**:
  - ✅ `migrate.api.dev` - Development migrations
  - ✅ `migrate.api.deploy` - Production migrations  
  - ✅ `migrate.api.reset` - Reset database
  - ✅ `migrate.api.dev.name` - Named migrations
- **Migration created**: ✅ `20250817144849_subplans_and_categorization`
- **Database updated**: ✅ New schema applied successfully
- **API tested**: ✅ All new fields working (category, project, activity, subPlanId, SUB_PLAN type)

## Feature Summary ✅
**Task Sub-Plans and Plan Categorization** - IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ Tasks can now be sub-plans (subPlanId field)
- ✅ Plans can be categorized by Project, Activity, Milestone, or Sprint
- ✅ New TaskType SUB_PLAN added
