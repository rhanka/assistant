# Component Lifecycle Management

## Objective
Implement component lifecycle management strategy with technical debt tracking and automated audit capabilities.

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETED** - Component lifecycle management strategy fully implemented and integrated

## Tasks Completed
- [x] Create `.cursor/rules/components.mdc` with lifecycle directives
- [x] Create `.components/tech-debt-<service>.md` files for each service
- [x] Define Docker-based audit commands structure
- [x] Create Make targets for component auditing in Makefile
- [x] Refactor to use service-specific auditing with `make audit.components.<service>`
- [x] Prioritize OS and stack auditing in components.mdc
- [x] Add infrastructure debt tracking (`tech-debt-infra.md`)
- [x] Document architecture "to be" with service-specific approach
- [x] Correct infrastructure scope (Docker/K8s/Scaleway, not runtime stacks)
- [x] Fix security audit targets for infrastructure (iac-infra, container-infra)
- [x] Add database OS auditing with `make audit.docker.db-os`

## Tasks Remaining
- [x] Implement initial component audit to populate tech-debt backlog with real data
- [x] Test all audit commands work correctly in Docker environment
- [x] Update TODO.md to mark task as complete
- [x] Identify breaking changes in major version updates (Vite 7.x, NestJS 11.x)
- [x] Create PR with conventional commit
- [x] Update workflow.mdc to ensure tech-debt updates during component upgrades
- [x] Update components.mdc to integrate with feature workflow
- [x] Add TODO items for major component upgrades identified in tech-debt

## Technical Approach
- **Docker-first**: All audit commands execute in containers
- **Make orchestration**: All operations go through Make targets
- **Integration**: Leverage existing security testing infrastructure
- **No duplication**: Reference existing .mdc files for detailed rules

## Questions Before Implementation
1. Should audit commands be interactive by default (like other Make targets)?
2. Any specific error handling requirements for failed audits?
3. Should audit results be cached or always fresh?

## Next Step
Feature complete. Ready for PR creation and merge to main.
