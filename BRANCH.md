# Feature: Stack Upgrade

## Objective
Perform initial stack upgrade for all services to latest stable versions, focusing on critical components with breaking changes assessment.

## Plan / Todo
- [x] **Alpine 3.22 & DB upgrades**: Update PostgreSQL and Redis to use Alpine 3.22 base images and upgrade to latest versions
- [x] **Vitest 3.x Migration**: Update all Node.js services from 1.0.0 to 3.2.4 (UI, API, Scheduler, Workers) - breaking changes assessment required
- [x] **Vite 7.x Migration**: Update UI service from 5.3.0 to 7.1.3 - build configuration and plugin compatibility to validate
- [x] **NestJS 11.x Migration**: Update API service from 10.0.0 to 11.1.6 - decorator and module changes to implement
- [x] **Docker add dev target**: Make working dev target
- [o] **Apollo Server 5.x Migration**: Update API service from 4.12.2 to 5.0.0 - GraphQL schema and resolver compatibility to validate
- [x] **Python 3.13 Migration**: Update AI service from 3.11.13 to 3.13.7 - syntax and feature compatibility to validate

## Notes
- The upgrade to Apollo Server v5 is currently blocked. The latest version of `@nestjs/apollo` (`v12.1.0`) is not yet compatible with Apollo Server v5 and causes runtime errors. This task will be revisited once the NestJS ecosystem officially supports it.

## Commits & Progress
- [x] **Commit 1** (be669f0): Task 1 completed.
- [x] **Commit 2** (ef2b7f8): Documentation updates for Apollo v5 blocker.
- [x] **Commit 3** (current): Python 3.13 migration completed.

## Status
- **Progress**: 2/2 tasks completed
- **Current**: Completed Task 1 and Python 3.13 migration
- **Next**: Update tech-debt files and complete testing strategy

## Breaking Changes Assessment
- Vitest 3.x: Major breaking changes expected, requires test configuration updates
- Vite 7.x: Build configuration changes, plugin compatibility validation needed
- NestJS 11.x: Decorator and module changes, GraphQL schema updates required
- Apollo Server 5.x: GraphQL resolver compatibility, schema validation needed
- Python 3.13: Syntax changes, feature compatibility validation required

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Multiple major version upgrades simultaneously
- **Mitigation**: Upgrade one service at a time, comprehensive testing between each
- **Rollback Plan**: Keep previous versions in git history, use Docker tags for rollback
