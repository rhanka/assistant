# Feature: Test Strategy Implementation

## Objective
Implement comprehensive testing strategy with make commands, unit tests, E2E tests, and CI integration to ensure all testing goes through the Makefile (Docker-first approach).

## Plan / Todo
- [x] Consolidate AI directives into core .mdc files
- [x] Add testing infrastructure configurations (Jest, pytest, Playwright)
- [x] Implement unit tests for core services (scheduler, workers, API, AI)
- [x] Add UI pages and E2E tests (plans, runs)
- [x] Update Makefile and CI with test commands
- [x] Update documentation and package dependencies
- [x] Add BRANCH.md validation to prevent merge with branch files
- [x] Remove root package.json (everything must be driven by make)
- [ ] Ensure make test.unit works correctly
- [ ] Validate all test commands through make
- [ ] Test CI workflow with make commands

## Commits & Progress
- [x] **Commit 1** (4ac4bfb): Consolidate AI directives into core .mdc files
- [x] **Commit 2** (9c98adf): Add testing infrastructure configurations
- [x] **Commit 3** (273fbc7): Implement unit tests for core services
- [x] **Commit 4** (2e8a329): Add UI pages and E2E tests
- [x] **Commit 5** (24dfec3): Update Makefile and CI with test commands
- [x] **Commit 6** (1f0206f): Update documentation and package dependencies
- [x] **Commit 7** (0c01c66): Add BRANCH.md validation to prevent merge with branch files
- [x] **Commit 8** (3998943): Enforce make-first architecture and clean node_modules

## Status
- **Progress**: 8/10 tasks completed (80%)
- **Current**: Make-first architecture enforced, root package.json removed
- **Next**: Test and validate make test.unit functionality

## Notes
- All commits follow atomic commit guidelines (max 10-15 files per commit)
- Testing infrastructure is in place but needs validation
- Make commands are defined but need to be tested
- Documentation is updated to reflect current state

## Remaining Work
1. **Remove root package.json** - Enforce make-first approach, no direct npm commands
2. **Test make test.unit** - Ensure Docker services can run tests
3. **Validate test commands** - Verify all make test.* work correctly
4. **Test CI workflow** - Ensure GitHub Actions use make commands properly
