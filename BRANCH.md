# Feature: Test Strategy Implementation

## Objective
Implement comprehensive testing strategy with make commands, unit tests, E2E tests, and CI integration to ensure all testing goes through the Makefile (Docker-first approach).

## Plan / Todo
- [x] Consolidate AI directives into core .mdc files
- [x] Add testing infrastructure configurations (Jest, pytest, Playwright)
- [x] Implement unit tests for core services (scheduler, workers, API, AI)
- [x] Add UI pages and E2E tests (plans, runs)
- [x] Update Makefile and CI with test commands
- [x] Update documentation and package dependencies
- [x] Add BRANCH.md validation to prevent merge with branch files
- [x] Remove root package.json (everything must be driven by make)
- [x] Complete Docker-first architecture and test infrastructure
- [x] Implement optimized CI strategy (path-based testing + P2P)
- [x] Fix CI workflows to match testing strategy (remove obsolete ci.yml, fix ci-global, add P2P)
- [x] Complete P2P integration workflows (workers-api, ui-api, scheduler-workers)
- [x] Consolidate all CI workflows into single ci.yml with conditional jobs and dependencies
- [x] Fix context access issues and commit CI consolidation (63fbfa5)
- [x] Update testing strategy documentation
- [x] Commit documentation updates (ea3cb40)
- [x] Add push trigger support to CI workflow for testing validation
- [x] Fix CI workflow linter errors and commit fixes (946cda4)
- [x] Add .github/workflows/ci.yml to all job conditions (01efe73)
- [ ] Validate CI workflow with optimized testing

## Status
- **Progress**: 15/16 tasks completed (94%)
- **Current**: Testing strategy documentation updated in README.md
- **Next**: Validate CI workflow with optimized testing

## Notes
- All commits follow atomic commit guidelines (max 10-15 files per commit)
- Testing infrastructure is in place but needs validation
- Make commands are defined but need to be tested
- Documentation is updated to reflect current state

## Remaining Work
1. **Remove root package.json** - Enforce make-first approach, no direct npm commands
2. **Test make test.unit** - Ensure Docker services can run tests
3. **Validate test commands** - Verify all make test.* work correctly
4. **Test CI workflow** - Ensure GitHub Actions use make commands properly
